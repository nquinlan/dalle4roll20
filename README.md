## Installation & Usage

This extension has yet to be released in the Chrome webstore. If you'd like to use it:

1. Download the latest release ([`release.zip`](/release.zip)).
2. Navigate to the Chrome Extensions screen (`chrome://extensions`)
3. Ensure "Developer mode" is on, using the toggle in the top right corner of the screen.
4. Select "Load unpacked", navigating to this extension on your computer.

Additionally, in order to use this plugin, you'll need to register for an [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). The DALLE•2 API is metered and you will need to pay per request as detailed on [Open AI's pricing page](https://openai.com/api/pricing/).

Once you have the asset up and running, and your API key stored, you can make any "search" and get results per your prompt & parameters. Clicking an image downloads it. You may then drag to upload it to your Roll20 asset library.
